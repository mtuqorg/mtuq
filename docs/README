HOW TO UPDATE DOCS


1. Install sphinx

    >> conda install sphinx=4 sphinx_bootstrap_theme

    Note that we use an earlier version of sphinx because later versions seem to 
    mess up the spacing of docs/library/index.html


2. Create local build

>> ./build.bash


3. If build fails with "Encountered unknown tag 'do'", try the following:

   Modify the sphinx autosummary source code by adding  'jinja2.ext.do' to the jinja
   Environment() extensions list

   See in particular this line of the autosummary source code:

   https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/a6032e852a650c070aed66f0790e612905159f15/sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py#L111

4. Inspect the resulting HTML files in _build/html.


5. If the local build is satisfactory, then push the changes to the remote:

>> ./push.bash
