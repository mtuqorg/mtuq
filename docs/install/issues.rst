Installation on Apple M1 and Apple M2 Macs
------------------------------------------

Newer Mac computers use proprietary Apple processors based on the ARM64 architecture.  On these and other ARM64 systems, a modified `conda env` command is necessary

.. code::

   conda env update --file env_arm64.yaml

but otherwise users can follow the normal installation procedure.

For more information, please see:

`MTUQ installation on ARM64 systems <https://uafgeotools.github.io/mtuq/install/arm64.html>`_


Installation under virutalenv
-----------------------------

For most users, we recommend installing MTUQ under conda.  However, in rare cases it seems that MTUQ can be more easily installed under virtualenv.

For more information, please see:

`MTUQ installation under virtualenv <https://uafgeotools.github.io/mtuq/install/virtualenv.html>`_


Troubleshooting PyGMT installation
----------------------------------

MTUQ uses full moment tensor plotting functions from the PyGMT graphics library.

To avoid a known issue with PyGMT installation under conda, it is necessary to specify a minimum PyGMT version as follows:

.. code::

    conda install 'pygmt>=0.9'


A more conservative approach, which avoids suspected problems with PyGMT 0.10 releases, is to specify the more stable PyGMT 0.9 version:

.. code::

    conda install 'pygmt=0.9'


If PyGMT installation fails, most MTUQ functions will still work, but some plotting functions will fall back to GMT or ObsPy.  

We note that some versions of GMT and ObsPy do not plot `full moment tensors <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/issues/2388>`_ correctly.
