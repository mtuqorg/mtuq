Installation
============

If you're familiar with Python virtual environments, feel free to install MTUQ as follows within an environment of your choice::

   git clone https://github.com/uafgeotools/mtuq.git
   cd mtuq
   pip install -e .


Otherwise, follow these instructions for installation under `conda` (preferred) or `virtualenv`:

.. toctree::

   env_conda
   env_virtualenv



Graphics dependencies
---------------------

.. warning::

   To avoid graphics problems, we recommend installing PyGMT.

MTUQ uses `PyGMT <https://www.pygmt.org/latest/>`_ if present.  PyGMT is not installed by default, but requires an extra `conda install pygmt`.

If PyGMT is not present, MTUQ may fall back to GMT or ObsPy.  We note that some versions of GMT and ObsPy do not plot full moment tensors correctly (`see here <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/issues/2388>`_).
