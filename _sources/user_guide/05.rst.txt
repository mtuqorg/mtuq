Visualization galleries
=======================

As illustrated in the `examples <https://github.com/mtuqorg/mtuq/blob/master/examples>`_, MTUQ can be used to carry out grid searches over full moment tensors, double couple moment tensors, and forces. 

The output of `mtuq.grid_search` in each of these cases is a data structure that can be passed directly to visualization functions.  Examples include:
 

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   05/gallery_mt
   05/gallery_force
   05/gallery_origin
